My Holy Grail

The main purpose of this project is to create a user friendly database, to list their favourite makeup products, share their opinions and rank the best of the best products with the clear winner on the top. It’s like a sifter through endless products of this vast industry to help find what you actually might want or need. 

UX

This project was created with the intent to impact the way makeup users look for new products. The general idea was to make a platform where makeup users state their favourite products, their number ones, a place where the bad products are weeded out, and users can sift through products that are already perceived to be attention and money worthy. Registered users are able to list their favourite makeup products in 9 main categories, write a review with the listing, add photos showing their experience with the product. If the product is already listed by someone else, other registered users are still able to add their reviews, photos, or just to cast a vote claiming that this product is their “holy grail” too. The higher the “holy grail” score, the higher the placement of the product in the websites corresponding category, therefore it is easiest to find for people looking for the best and most favored product.  I think this way of looking for something is at most efficient, when you can read through personal experiences, see what corresponds with what you are looking for (in sense of skin type, coverage, pigmentation etc.) and make a confident choice in such a vast Industry.

Colour scheme:

With the idea in mind that the products must be the thing that catches the eye the most, I chose to keep the colour scheme minimal in black, white and gold range. Simple, minimalistic and not clashing with the designs of the packaging of various products.
